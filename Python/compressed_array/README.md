## Problem Description

<b>This problem focuses on compressing a given array of characters chars using the following rules:</b>

- Consecutive characters in the array are grouped together.
- If the group's length is 1, the character is simply retained in the array.
- If the group's length is greater than 1, the character is followed by the group's length (represented as a string of digits).
- The compressed characters replace the original characters in the input array, and the function outputs the new, compressed array up to the modified length
- You must use only constant extra space, meaning no additional data structures like new arrays or lists are allowed.
