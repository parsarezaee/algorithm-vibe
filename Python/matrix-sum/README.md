## Matrix Sum of Specific Numbers

### Problem Description
Given a matrix, the goal is to sum up specific numbers based on certain conditions, such as summing the diagonal elements.

### Solution Explanation
1. **Input**: A matrix represented as a list of lists (rows and columns).
2. **Logic**:
   - Use nested loops to iterate over the matrix.
   - Apply a condition to select specific elements (e.g., summing only diagonal elements where row index equals column index).
3. **Output**: The total sum of the selected numbers.
